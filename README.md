## Introduction
Whether they've finished in last place or just won the title, NBA teams are always looking to improve their rosters through the draft. Every June, NBA teams hope to find the missing player(s) that will bring them to the next level. Oftentimes, NBA teams wind up dissapointed with their picks and leave their fans wondering why a player was even drafted in the first place. 

## Objective
Createa a model that can accurately predict how rookies will perform as NBA players by classifying them into one of four categories: Bust, Role Player, Starter and All-Star.
